# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - Today was definitely the biggest struggle I've had thus far, but collaborating with classmates helped immensely and I was able to finish everything.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - I'm typically pretty focused and try to put my nose to the grindstone to finish my work quickly, but that hasn't been the best approach with the content we've been working on. I find that taking the occasional break is a huge help and I feel great about my workflow.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
    - I don't feel that I need anything more than what I have to be ready - I'm excited to move forward and keep learning!
